<b>Christopher Carter, MD<br />
.NET Software Engineer<br />
Portland, OR</b>

My passion is writing readable, maintainable, and testable code, that adheres to best practices! I enjoy the entire breadth of developing--the challenges of the back-end, the creativity of the user interface, and the collaboration required for the business logic in-between.    One of the most satisfying aspects of developing software, for me, is when I can build an application which brings new capabilities to the business.

My coding story begins in the golden age of the Apple II, but really got going while I was conducting physics research at Lewis and Clark College, where I spent several years modeling physical systems on UNIX.
Later, in the Medical field, I designed and maintained databases to support our daily practice, and data analysis/visualization tools for quality-improvement.  These roots in scientific data analysis and visualization have fostered an interest in Python and its amazing libraries.
Most of my experience, however, has been in .NET, developing Web- and Windows-based applications using both C# and Visual Basic.
                         
When I'm not coding, I enjoy the good living of the Willamette Valley!
Excellent food, crisp ales and luxurious wines...  Come hike the Gorge, climb Mount Hood, or explore the Coast!  I am an instrument-rated pilot, and I fly whenever I can.  For a little more down-to-earth fun, I explore the area by bicycle.
