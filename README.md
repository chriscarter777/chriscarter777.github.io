<h4>Christopher Carter, MD</h4>
<b>.NET Software Engineer</b>
<b>Portland, OR</b>

I enjoy the entire breadth of developing--the challenges of the back-end, the creativity and detail-orientation of the user interface, and the collaboration involved in building the business logic in-between.  My passion is writing readable, maintainable, and testable code.  One of the most satisfying aspects of developing software, for me, is when I can build an application which not only supports a business process,
but allows that process to be enhanced because of the new tool capabilities.

While a researcher at Lewis and Clark College, I spent several years doing scientific modeling of physical systems.
Later, in the Medical field, I designed and maintained databases to support our daily practice, and data analysis/visualization tools for quality-improvement.  These roots in scientific data analysis and visualization have fostered an interest in Python and its amazing libraries.</p>
Most of my experience, however, has been in .NET, developing Web- and Windows-based applications using both C# and Visual Basic.
                         
When I'm not coding, I enjoy the good living of the Willamette Valley!
Excellent food, crisp ales and luxurious wines...  Come hike the Gorge, climb Mount Hood, or explore the Coast!  
I am an instrument-rated pilot, and I fly whenever I can.  
For a little more down-to-earth fun, I explore the area by bicycle.
